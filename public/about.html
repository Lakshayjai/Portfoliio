<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Lakshay Jain, a passionate programmer and tech enthusiast. I'm currently diving deep into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++, constantly improving my problem-solving skills. I enjoy working on projects that blend creativity with technology, such as web development and IoT-based solutions like my Centralized Monitoring System for Street Light Fault Detection and Location Tracking.</p>
 
<p>Beyond coding, I love experimenting with Arduino, ESP8266, and LED cubes, always looking for innovative ways to bring ideas to life. I’m also working on exciting projects like a Netflix clone, sharpening my web development skills along the way.
  Currently, I’m gearing up to tackle LeetCode problems and enhance my coding expertise. If you're passionate about technology, programming, or cool projects, let's connect and build something amazing together!
